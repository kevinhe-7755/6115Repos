<h2>Compare with another branch or version</h2>
<p>Since: M8<br>

<p>You should be able to select a project/folder/resource and
compare against another branch or version. Multi-select should work
across projects in different repositories. Once the comparison is shown
it should be possible to merge changes into the local workspace. It
should also be possible to remember the comparison, which will cause it
to appear in the synchronize view.</p>
<p>We should support multi-selection of files, but I'm not sure what
should be shown to the user in those cases.</p>
<h3>On file selected</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If the file has differences open a compare editor and show
	otherwise a message is shown to indicate that the file is the same.</li>
	<li>should be able to open the history view and link in to the
	opened compare editor</li>
	<li>the compare editor should update when changes are made to the
	local file in some other context (e.g other editor, refactoring).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple selection</h3>
<p>Entire contents of the folder are compared deep. If changes are
found the user is notified and they are shown in a dialog. If no changes
are found the user is notified. The dialog should allow the user to
browse the changes and merge anything into his workspace. If the user
wants to keep the comparison non-model, he can add it to the synchronize
view. There is a button to do so on the compare dialog.</p>

<h3>Merging changes</h3>
<p>When the compare dialog is showing several changes you should be
able to selectively merge anything into the local workspace. Specific
attention should be made to the following cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Edit the local then press ok. You should be prompted to save
	the changes and the changes should be correctly updated in the
	corresponding resource.</li>
	<li>Edit the local and browse to another file. You should be
	prompted to save the changes.</li>
	<li>Press the cancel button with changes, you should be prompted.</li>
</ul>
