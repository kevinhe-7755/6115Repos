<h3>Compare a resource with other resource</h3>
<h5>The action</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The action should appear only when there are 2 or 3 resources
	selected.</li>
	<li>If there are 3 resources selected you should be prompted to
	select the common ancestor.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Look</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure that all titles and labels are ok (e.g. dialog title,
	structure pane title, compare editor labels...).</li>
	<li>Ensure that all buttons in the toolbar are properly enabled
	(e.g. Copy All/Copy Current, Next/Prev Difference/Change).</li>
	<li>Ensure that difference markers are properly display at start</li>
</ul>
<h5>Navigation</h5>
<ul>
	<li>If you reach the first/last difference you should be prompted
	to go to the end/start of the current element.</li>
	<li>Ensure that you can correctly navigate through differences
	using the difference markers on the right side of the editor.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Merging</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure that Copy All/Copy Current actions work as expected.</li>
	<li>Ensure that when the Copy All action is used all difference
	markers disappear.</li>
	<li>Ensure that when the Copy Current action is used a proper
	difference marker disappears.</li>
	<li>Ensure you can Undo an action.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Saving</h5>
<ul>
	<li>If you edit a local resource the dirty state indicator should
	appear over the resource.</li>
	<li>If you edit a local resource and the resource is also opened
	in a different editor the dirty state should appear on that editor too.</li>
	<li>If you edit both of the resources being compare (both are
	local), changes should be saved to both of them.</li>
	<li>If you edit a resource and close the editor you should be
	prompted to save or abandon changes.</li>
	<li>If you edit both of the resources and close the editor you
	should be prompted to select which resources to save using the Save
	Resources dialog.</li>
	<li>Ensure you can Undo a change.</li>
	<li>Ensure that changes are saved correctly to the underlying
	resource.</li>
