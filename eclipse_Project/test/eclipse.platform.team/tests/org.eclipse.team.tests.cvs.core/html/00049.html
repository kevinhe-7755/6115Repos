There are many standard decorations in the sync view. Most significant
are the propagated flags.

<h3>Conflicts</h3>

<p>Conflicting changes should be propagated to parent resources such
that you can easily see, when the tree is collapsed that there are
conflicts. When the conflict is resolved, the parent conflict markers
should be removed.</p>

<h3>Error and Warning problem markers</h3>

<p>Error and warning makers are shown on resources and propagated to
parent resources such that you can easily see if you are releasing
errors or warnings.</p>

<h3>Branch changes</h3>

<p>Changes to branches, revisions, should be updated automatically
in the views decorators. For example, if you branch from the sync view
the branch name should appear.</p>
