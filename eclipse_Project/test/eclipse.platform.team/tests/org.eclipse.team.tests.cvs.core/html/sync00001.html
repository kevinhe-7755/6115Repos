<h3>Making Manual Changes</h3>

<p>Create a conflicting file change. Manually edit the left source
pane in the sync view. Hit "Save" on the popup menu. The file should
remain a Conflict. Choose Mark as Merged in the popup menu of the tree.
The file should change to an outgoing change. Commit the outgoing
change.</p>

<h3>Merging Conflicts</h3>

<p>Try Override and Update with different combinations of
Auto-Mergeable and Non-Mergeable conflicts in the selection. If all
conflicts are Non-Mergeable, then the only choice is to replace with
remote or cancel. If one or more conflicts are Auto-Mergeable, the
choices are (a) Auto-Merge any applicable files, and replace the rest
with remote, (b) Replace all files with remote or (c) Cancel.</p>

<h3>Removing from View</h3>

<p>Choose Remove from View. Selected nodes should disappear. Refresh
the view. The nodes should reappear.</p>

<h3>Working with Branches</h3>

<p>Try any and all of the above, but use a branch instead of HEAD.
Behavior should be identical. The sync view decorator should show you
the name of the branch.</p>

<h3>Using Mixed Tags</h3>

<p>Using Team-&gt;Branch, Replace With-&gt;Branch or Version, and
Team-&gt;Tag as Version, you can create a project which has different
tags mixed into it. For example, one folder may be shared as V2_0, a
single file may be attached to the branch NEW_FEATURE_BRANCH, and the
root of the project may be attached to HEAD. We need to test usage of
these projects in the sync view. For example, if developer 1 has project
P shared with HEAD, and folder P/F is shared with branch B, have
developer 2 release a change to folder F in HEAD, and have developer 1
perform a sync. In this case developer 1 should not see the incoming
change.</p>
