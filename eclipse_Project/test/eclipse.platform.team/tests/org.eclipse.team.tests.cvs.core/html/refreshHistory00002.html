<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>Since: 3.2 RC2<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/18 13:54:38 $</p>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> Test the two types of refresh behavior available
in the history view</p>

<h3>Automatic Refresh</h3>

<p>When a local file is modified and saved, a refresh event is sent
out and the history view should show the newest revision. This will work
for both local history and CVS history files. (CVS files need to have
the history view in the appropriate viewing mode: either "Remote and
Local Revisions" or "Local Revisions".)</p>

<ol>
	<li>With a file history in the History View, and the viewer in an
	appropriate mode if a CVS file, open an editor on the workspace copy of
	the file in the history view.</li>
	<li>Edit the file and save.</li>
	<li>Verify that a new local revision gets added to the history
	view which reflects your change.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Manual Refresh</h3>

<p>There is also a Refresh button on the toolbar. This is mainly
useful for CVS file histories if you want to check if any revisions have
been committed. Note that its not really of any use for local revisions
as they are updated automatically.</p>

<ol>
	<li>With a CVS file history in the History View, make a change to
	the file and save. (You should see the local version updated in the
	history view.)</li>
	<li>Commit the file.</li>
	<li>Hit the Refresh toolbar button and verify that the new
	revision gets displayed in the history view,</li>
</ol>
