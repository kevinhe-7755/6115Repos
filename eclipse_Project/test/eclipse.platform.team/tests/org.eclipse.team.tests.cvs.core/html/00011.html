<h2>Synchronize View</h2>
<p>Since: 3.0<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/23 13:19:14 $</p>

<h3>Synchronize View Modes</h3>

<p>Ensure that choosing direction modes result in proper filtering.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Incoming mode contains incoming changes and conflicts.</li>
	<li>Outgoing mode contains outgoing changes and conflicts.</li>
	<li>Both mode contains all change types.</li>
	<li>Conflict mode contains only conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also ensure that there are no empty containers (e.g folders or
projects) in any of the modes.</p>

<h3>Synchronize View Models</h3>

<p>Ensure that each model contains the appropriate output. Models to
test include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All Models: Projects should contain content from the highest
	level model (e.g. Java projects contains Java content like packages
	while non-Java projects contains folders).</li>
	<li>Workspace: All projects are shown and contain folders. For
	this model, also test the presentation types (Flat, Hierarchical and
	Compressed Folders).</li>
	<li>Java: Only Java projects are present and contain Java content
	(e.g. packages). Also ensure that any resource content is present (e.g.
	non-source folders).</li>
	<li>Change Sets: All changes are grouped by change set.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also ensure that mode switching works properly for each model
type.</p>

<h3>Synchronize View Operations</h3>
<p>Ensure Commit and Update buttons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>operate on all applicable changes</li>
	<li>prompt in some form before executing</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure Update menu action:</p>
<ul>
	<li>is enabled when selection contains incoming or conflicting
	changes</li>
	<li>operates only on selected changes</li>
	<li>silently handles mergable conflicts</li>
	<li>will prompt if conflicts are not mergable</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure Commit menu action</p>
<ul>
	<li>is enable when selection contains outgoing changes</li>
	<li>prompts for unadded resources</li>
	<li>operates only on selected changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure Override and Update</p>
<ul>
	<li>is enabled for outgoing and conflicting changes</li>
	<li>prompts to confirm</li>
	<li>operates only on selected changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure Mark as Merged</p>
<ul>
	<li>is enabled for incoming and conflicting changes</li>
	<li>operates only on selected changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure Refresh button refreshes all projects regardless of mode,
selection or working set.</p>
<p>Ensure Refresh menu action refreshes only the selection</p>

<p>All actions on large sets</p>
