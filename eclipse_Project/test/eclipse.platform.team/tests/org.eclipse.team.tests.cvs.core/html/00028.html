<h2>Reconnecting an existing project</h2>
<p>Since: 3.0 M6<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/23 13:19:15 $</p>
<p>The following scenario represents how a user would reconnect a
project that does not contain CVS meta-data to it's remote counterpart.
It is assumed that the local project was derived from a previous version
of the remote project but both the local project and the remote may have
been modified since then.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1: Existing location using project name</h3>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Load an existing project (using Checkout or you could import a
	plug-in project from the target area).</li>
	<li>Disconnect the project and indicate that CVS meta-data is to
	be deleted.</li>
	<li>Modify some local resources.</li>
	<li>Optionally, modify the remote contents of some resources using
	a separate checkout.</li>
	<li>Perform a Team>Share Project and select CVS (if there is more
	than one repository provider available).</li>
	<li>Select the repository the project was loaded from and click
	Next.</li>
	<li>Use the project name as the module name. Click Next.</li>
	<li>In the tag page, select HEAD as the branch to share with and
	click Next.</li>
	<li>In the sharing page, only the files that do not have the same
	contents as the server should appear. Perform a Mark as Merged or
	Commit on these files.</li>
	<li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scenario 1: New location using custom module name</h3>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Load an existing project using Checkout As and a different
	name.</li>
	<li>Disconnect the project and indicate that CVS meta-data is to
	be deleted.</li>
	<li>Discard the repository location.</li>
	<li>Modify some local resources.</li>
	<li>Optionally, modify the remote contents of some resources using
	a separate checkout</li>
	<li>Perform a Team>Share Project and select CVS (if there is more
	than one repository provider available).</li>
	<li>Select to create a new repository and click Next.</li>
	<li>Enter the repository information for the repository and click
	Next.</li>
	<li>Enter the name of the module that the project was loaded from.
	Click Next.</li>
	<li>In the tag page, select HEAD as the branch to share with and
	click Next.</li>
	<li>In the sharing page, only the files that do not have the same
	contents as the server should appear. Perform a Mark as Merged or
	Commit on these files.</li>
	<li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>
