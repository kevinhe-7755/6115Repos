There are a couple of preferences that controls the behavior and
presentation of the console. To enable this testing, you must first
enable font and label decorations. This can be done by going to
<i>Window/Preferences/Team/CVS/Label Decorations</i>
and checking off
<b>"Enable font and color decorations"</b>
.
<p>These are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>font: changing the font should immediately update the sync
	view as well as all other views decorated by CVS (ie. Package
	Explorer).</li>
	<li>font color: message color, error color, command line. Changing
	these should immediately update the console view.</li>
</ul>
