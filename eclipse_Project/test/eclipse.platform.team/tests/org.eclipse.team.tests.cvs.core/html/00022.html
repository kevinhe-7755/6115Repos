<h3>Scenario 1: One Time Merge</h3>

<p>Using Team>Merge, merge the changes from a branch into HEAD. Once
completed, in the synchronize view, update the incoming changes, resolve
any conflicts and ensure they worked, After updating, redo the same
merge. A no-changes dialog should be presented since the local contents
match the end-point.
<p>Things to try:
<ul>
	<li>Use content assist to select an existing branch for the end
	tag. A root versions should be automatically found if it exists.</li>
	<li>Choose to perform the merge into the local workspace. Ensure
	it works with and without a start tag.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scenario 2: Ongoing Merge</h3>

After performing a one-time merge, pin the entry in the synchronize
view. Release changes to the end point (branch) and synchronize the
merge. The new changes should appear in the synchronize view. Update to
these changes as appropriate.

<h3>Scenario 3: Direct Merge</h3>

Perform a Team>Merge and choose to merge directly into the workspace.
Try both the case with a base tag and without it.

<h3>Removing a Merge</h3>

<p>Delete the merge from the synchronize view using the remove
toolbar button. The merge subscriber should be removed from the view.
