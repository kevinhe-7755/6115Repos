<p>Test that authentication, connection errors result in appropriate
error messages and that these don't pollute the log file or console. To
setup for these tests ensure there are a couple of shared projects in
your workspace.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Clear you log file before starting the tests and turn on the
	CVS quick diff provider.</li>
	<li>Perform an update, a synchronize, and open a file. The log
	should be empty and the operations should succeed.</li>
	<li>Disconnect from the network.</li>
	<li>Open a file. The CVS quick diff will fail and an error should
	be in the log.</li>
	<li>Synchronize all the shared projects. One error explaining the
	failures should be returned.</li>
	<li>Change the connection properties of one of the projects to
	point to an non-existing location. Then synchronize again, the error
	message should indicate that some succeeded and others failed. But the
	user should no that the operation did complete and skipped the failed
	projects.</li>
	<li>Expand the invalid location in the CVS repositories view. An
	appropriate error should be shown.</li>
</ul>
