<p>Check the following for all cases of replace:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Decorators are updated in the navigator/packages view and
	synchronize view.</li>
	<li>If a version is loaded that you can't commit to it</li>
	<li>If a branch is loaded, that you can commit to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also ensure that the tag filtering in the dialog works properly.</p>
