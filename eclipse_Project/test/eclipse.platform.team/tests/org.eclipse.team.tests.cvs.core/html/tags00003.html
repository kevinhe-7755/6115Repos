<h2>Tag Caching</h2>
<p>Since: 3.1 M4<br>

Discovered tags are cached locally to improve performance. Caching is
done in the following ways:

<ol>
	<li>Tags discovered for local resources are cached with the remote
	folder that the resource's project is mapped to.</li>
	<li>Tags discovered for remote resources are cached with the
	resource if it is a folder or the resource's parent if it is a file.</li>
</ol>

To test this, you can try one or more of the following:

<ol>
	<li>Perform Compare With on folders and subfolders in the
	repositories view. The first time, you will need to perform a Refresh \
	but subsequent times, the tags should be cached.</li>
	<li>Load non-root folders as projects and ensure tags are cached
	and obtained properly.</li>
	<li>Perform Tag with Existing in the History view and ensure that
	tags are obtained from the file</li>
</ol>
