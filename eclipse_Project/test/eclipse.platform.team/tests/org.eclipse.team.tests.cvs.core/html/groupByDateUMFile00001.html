<h2>Group Revisions by Date</h2>
<p>Since: 3.2 RC2 <br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/18 13:54:37 $</p>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> Test the group by date mechanism for both local
history and CVS history.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the History view.</li>
	<li>Roll back your system clock 1 day, make a change to your local
	unmapped file and save it.</li>
	<li>Roll back your system clock to the beginning of the month and
	make some changes to the local unmapped file and save it.</li>
	<li>Roll back your system clock to anywhere before the beginning
	of the current month, make a change to the local unmapped file and save
	it.</li>
	<li>Reset your clock to the current date and show the file's
	history (DND or [Team>Show Local History]/[Team>Show History] for local
	and CVS files respectively).</li>
	<li>Verify that the revisions appear in the appropriate
	categories: Today, Yesterday, This Month and Previous.</li>
	<li>Click the Group by Revisions Date button and make sure that
	the categories toggle on and off.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above should be tested with history from both an unmanaged
file and a CVS file.</p>
