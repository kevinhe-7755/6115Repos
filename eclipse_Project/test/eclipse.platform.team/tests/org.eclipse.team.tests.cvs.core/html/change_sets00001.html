<h3>Change Sets for incoming changes</h3>

To perform these scenarios you will need to get one or more projects in
your workspace that have many incoming changes. Preferably all the
changes will have commit comments and some files will share a comment.
Once you have this setup, you can perform the following sub-scenarios.

<h4>Enabling/disabling Change Sets</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Synchronize the projects with HEAD, enable change set mode and
	ensure that the files appear in the proper change sets. Also ensure
	that the proper sub-layout is used by expanding some of the nodes in
	the tree.</li>
	<li>With some nodes expanded and additionally one or more
	selected, disable Change Sets. The same nodes should remain expanded
	and selected.</li>
	<li>With the same nodes selected and expanded, re-enable change
	sets. The expansion should remain. There may be more expanded if the
	same expanded project or folder appears in multiple change sets. The
	selection will remain unless there are two entries for the same
	resource (i.e. if a project was selected and it appears in multiple
	sets, it will no longer be expanded).</li>
</ol>

You should also confirm that markers and conflicts are properly
propagated to parent nodes.

<h4>Change Set Modes</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Switch between the various modes and ensure that the displayed
	nodes are correct. Also ensure that expansion and selection is
	maintained.</li>
	<li>Only Incoming and Outgoing mode show change sets.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Updating</h4>
With several nodes expanded, perform an update on one or more files that
are incoming changes. Ensure that the updated files are removed from the
view and that other expanded nodes remain expanded.

<h3>Outgoing Sets</h3>

The following aspects of outgoing change sets should be tested:
<ol>
	<li>Modified files can be added to a new or existing change set.
	Ensure that when they are added, the file remains visible in the Sync
	view.</li>
	<li>Files in a change set can be transfered to another change set</li>
	<li>If there is a default change set, any modified file that is
	not already part of a change set is placed in the default set. Files
	that are already in a set should stay in that set if more changes are
	made to the files.</li>
	<li>The title and comment of a change set can be changed.</li>
	<li>Layout and modes changes work properly for outgoing change
	sets in the Synchronize view.</li>
	<li>Committing one or more files in a change set will result in a
	commit dialog that is primed with the comment from the set.</li>
	<li>change sets (including which is the default), are preserved
	across restarts.</li>
</ol>
