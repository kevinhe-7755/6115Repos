<h2>Common Toolbar Buttons</h2>
<p>Since: 3.2 RC2 <br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/09/06 15:23:00 $</p>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> Test the functionality of the various buttons
common to both the Local File History page and the CVS History page</p>

Note: Even though the functionality is the same for both pages, the
tests should be conducted on both an unmanaged file and a CVS file as
each history page has its own respective implementation for the
following actions.
