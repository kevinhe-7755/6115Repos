<h2>Editing Files</h2>
<p>Since: <br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/18 13:54:37 $</p>

<p>These tests are to sanity check editors behavior relating to
calling validateEdit. The tests will try to cover all cases where files
are changed by the validateEdit handler and changes are made to the
read-only bit.</p>

<p>These test cases outline the expected behavior of single file
editors in terms of calling validateEdit and handling of error
conditions. All scenarios assume that a repository provider is mapped to
a project and has created a sandbox with files that are marked
read-only.</p>

<p>The <a
	href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.team.examples.filesystem/">
org.eclipse.team.example.filesystem</a> plugin is a repository provider that
simulates a pessimistic workflow. You can use it to run these tests and
validate (no pun intended) your validateEdit editor support. To use the
pessimistic provider, share a project with the repository provider
called "File System Pessimistic Example" and then you can add to control
the files and checkin/checkout will toggle the read-only bit and touch
the file. You can change the behavior of the validateEdit call via the
pessimistic preference page. For example, you can force the operation to
fail and update contents of the file when checked out.</p>

<p>These tests should be run against the following combinations of
tools:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Different repository providers</li>
	<li>Single file editors (java, text)</li>
	<li>Multiple file editors (manifest editor, ...)</li>
</ul>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S1: Repository provider enabled and files are readable</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that is not marked read-only in a project
	configured with a repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validate edit should not be called.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S2: Validate edit called on first edit</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a
	repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validateEdit should be called.</li>
	<li>validateEdit returns OK, the users edit is accepted and shows
	up in the editor, and the file can be edited normally.</li>
	<li>The user saves the file, and then can continue editing without
	validateEdit being called.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S2b: Validate edit canceled</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a
	repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validateEdit should be called.</li>
	<li>validateEdit is canceled, the users edit is not accepted and
	the file cannot be edited.</li>
	<li>The user should still be able to browse the contents of the
	file and trying to edit it again</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S2b: Validate edit fails with an error</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a
	repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validateEdit should be called.</li>
	<li>validateEdit is canceled, the users edit is not accepted and
	the file cannot be edited. User should be shown the error returned from
	the validateEdit provider.</li>
	<li>The user should still be able to browse the contents of the
	file and trying to edit it again</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S3: Validate edit called on subsequent edits if file changes
state</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a
	repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validateEdit should be called.</li>
	<li>validateEdit returns OK, the user's edit is accepted and the
	file can be edited normally.</li>
	<li>The user saves the file, and then can continue editing without
	validateEdit being called.</li>
	<li>The user saves the file and then checks in the file while the
	editor is still open.</li>
	<li>After the checkin completes the user continues editing the
	file.</li>
	<li>Validate edit should be called again.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S4: Validate edit not called after contents changed</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a
	repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validateEdit should be called.</li>
	<li>validateEdit returns OK, the user's edit is accepted and the
	file can be edited normally.</li>
	<li>The user saves the file, and then can continue editing without
	validateEdit being called.</li>
	<li>The user saves the file and keeps the editor opened.</li>
	<li>The user then un-checks out the file and new file contents are
	retrieved from the server.</li>
	<li>The new file contents are loaded into the editor and
	validateEdit is not called.</li>
	<li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S5: Validate edit changes file contents editor not-dirty</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a
	repository provider.</li>
	<li>Start editing the file, validateEdit should be called.</li>
	<li>validateEdit returns OK and brings in new content from the
	server.</li>
	<li>The new content is loaded automatically because the editor
	isn't dirty yet.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h3>S6: Validate edit changes file contents editor dirty</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open a file that has been checked out as read-only from a

	<li>validateEdit returns OK and the file on disk doesn't change.</li>
	<li>The user continues editing the file and then checks it in.</li>
	<li>The editor remains open and dirty, the user continues editing.</li>

	<li>validateEdit is called because the file is now read-only and
	returns OK and brings in new content from the server.</li>
	<li>The editor detects the timestamp change and prompts about the
	conflict and provides <a href="#reload_options">options</a> to the
	user.</li>
	<li>After the user selects his option and the user continues
	editing, the editor will call validateEdit.</li>

<a name="reload_options"><h3>Conflict Resolution Options for Editors</h3>
<pre>
Assumptions:  
    1. Editors currently maintain a "dirty bit" indicating that the in-memory
       buffer has been modified and not yet written to disk.  Editors call
       validateEdit() the if the file is read-only and the dirty bit is going
       from the clean state to the dirty state.
    2. Editors can detect when the timestamp of the file has changed on disk
       and prompt the user for the appropriate action.

Suggestion:
    Editors should maintain a separate bit, "must call validateEdit()".  Any
    modification of the buffer calls validateEdit() first if this bit is set.
    It is initially set when the file is opened if the file is read-only.  It
    is cleared after a successful call to validateEdit().  It is set again
    when the editor notices that a file has gone from read/write to read-only.

    If the "must call validateEdit()" bit ever goes from the cleared state to
    the set state (except for when the file is initially opened), a later
    successful call to validateEdit(), should should result in the following
    actions:

    +-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------+
    | Dirty Bit | Timestamp Change | Editor Action                          |
    |   State   |     Detected     |                                        |
    +-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------+
    |     0     |        no        | No action required                     |
    +-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------+
    |     1     |        no        | No action required                     |
    +-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------+
    |     0     |        yes       | Prompt user for reload/no-reload/merge |
    +-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------+
    |     1     |        yes       | Prompt user for reload/no-reload/merge |
    +-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------+
