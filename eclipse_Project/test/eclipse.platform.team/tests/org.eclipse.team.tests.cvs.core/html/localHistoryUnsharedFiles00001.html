<h2>Local History for Unshared Files</h2>

<p>This section tests the History View's behavior towards files that
reside in projects that have not been mapped to any Repository Provider.</p>

<h2>Setup Procedure for all Unshared Local History Tests</h2>
<p>All of the tests require the following steps completed prior to
any test case execution. These steps need only be done once for this
entire subsection. These steps ensure that some local history is
generated for the unmapped file.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a new Java project and add a new class to it.</li>
	<li>Add a field to the class and save.</li>
	<li>Add another field to the class and save.</li>
	<li>Add a method to the class and save.</li>
	<li>Add another method to the class and save.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the file has some history to it, you can proceed with
this test suite.</p>
