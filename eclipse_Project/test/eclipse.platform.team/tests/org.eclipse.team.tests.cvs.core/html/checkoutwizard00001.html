<h2>Checkout Wizard</h2>
<p>Since: <br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/23 13:19:14 $</p>

<p>The checkout wizard should be available from the following parts
of the workbench: import, new project, empty workspace CVS synchronize
action, toolbar in CVS perspective. The checkout wizard is also
available from the context menu of the repositories view as the Checkout
As menu item.</p>

The following variants should be tested:
<ul>
	<li>Create a new repository location and checkout a project
	entirely from the wizard.</li>
	<li>Check out a tag</li>
	<li>Check out a project that does not contain a .project file.
	This should result in a second wizard that allows project configuration
	(e.g. Java project).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repositories View Checkout Variants</h3>
These tests require an existing repository which contains projects, at
least one of which does not contain a .project file.

<ol>
	<li>Perform "Check Out" on a single project. Ensure that repeating
	results in overwrite prompt.</li>
	<li>Perform "Check Out" on multiple projects.</li>
	<li>Perform "Check Out As..." on a single project (that contains a
	.project file) and enter custom name and/or custom location.</li>
	<li>Perform "Check Out As..." on a single remote project that does
	not have a .project file and ensure that the user is prompted for the
	project type to create.</li>
	<li>Perform "Check Out As..." on multiple projects and enter a
	custom parent location.</li>
	<li>Perform "Check Out As..." and specify a tag.</li>
</ol>
