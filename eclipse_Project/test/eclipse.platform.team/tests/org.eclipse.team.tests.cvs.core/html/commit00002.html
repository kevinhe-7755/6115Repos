<h2>Committing Changes</h2>
<p>Since: 3.1 M4<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2007/05/18 13:54:37 $</p>

<h3>Committing changes to existing files</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Edit some existing files in a CVS project</li>
	<li>Choose Team>Commit on the project from the Navigator</li>
	<li>The commit dialog should show a preview of the files that are
	to be committed and allow a commit comment to be entered.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some things to try:
<ul>
	<li>Committing a project (or selected resources) that contain no
	changes will prompt to indicate this.</li>
	<li>Files can be removed from the preview area and these will be
	excluded from the commit.</li>
	<li>Clicking OK without entering a comment should prompt.</li>
	<li>Emptying the preview area will disable the Finish and show a
	"no changes" message.</li>
	<li>Try different page layouts (compressed, tree and flat)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Committing new files</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Add a few new files to a project including some with unknown
	extensions and some with no extensions.</li>
	<li>Choose Team>Commit on the project from the Navigator</li>
	<li>The first page of the commit wizard will allow you to
	configure the file types for any new files whose content type cannot be
	determined.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Configure some to be remembered and others to be only applied
		to this commit (verify after that this was done properly)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Click Next and verify that the content type was determined
	properly.</li>
	<li>Choose to ignore one of the files and verify that the file is
	removed and the .cvsignore appears.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Committing files contained in a Change Set</h3>
<ol>
	<li>From the Synchronize view, select all the changes from the
	same Change Set.</li>
	<li>Choose Commit and verify that the comment in the commit dialog
	is the one from the change Set.</li>
</ol>
