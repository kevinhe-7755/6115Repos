      This call is to get MD5 hash sums included. We do NOT call pack, since

      This is a work around we can likely remove eventually. See bug 406263.
      For PATCH_BUILDs we call twice, once with doPack=false, (do we can do zip file,
      without pack.gz files, and a second time, with doPack=true, for
      better access via http.

      See bug 406389 for why we remove rcp.configuration.feature ...
      it too is a "build time" mechanism, but not valid to install.

      Note: we mirror first (with comparator) to leave original repository in build machines
      drop directory untouched. That allows for emergency "redos" without rebuilding, plus,
      in case there are differences, it
      allows an easy way to compare "old" with "new" (at least for a few days), until
      build drop is cleaned off.
    -->

    <!--
      We run this mirror task, rather than a straight copy, in order to
      do a sanity check with traditional comparator. There should be few differences
      from buildtime comparator log, but might be some special cases, such as when
      third party jars change. See
      https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=402448
