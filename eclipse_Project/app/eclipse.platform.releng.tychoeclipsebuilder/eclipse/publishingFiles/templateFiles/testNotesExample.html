<!--
this file, is not part of routine build, but occasionally may
be renamed, edited, or added directly to "build page" directory
to describe some specific "extra information" about one particular build's
test results.

If the file is renamed to "testNotes.html" it's contents will be displayed
in "test results table".

Normally should just be a sentence or two, perhaps pointing to a bug
or wiki page. For example, below is what we used for final Juno Release.

<p>The unit test failures below do not impact the quality of the release. The
failures are due to a recent transition to new build and test infrastructure,
and the tests pass on other machines. For complete details see the <a
  href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=381873">umbrella tracking
  bug</a> and the <a
  href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=381992">final sign-off
  page</a> for Juno.</p>
